# Cairo by Example

## Introduction

The objective of this tutorial is to quickly on-board new developers to Cairo. The first experience newcomers have with Cairo and Starknet should be smooth and in 15' they should have everything setup and a good overview on what the language is all about.

Go to webpage to learn how to install and write [Cairo](https://cairo-lang.org) in simple and direct steps.

Most of the CSS and hugo code was taken modified from [noir-by-example](https://github.com/sambarnes/noir-by-example/).
Most of the code is taken from [Cairo Book](https://cairo-book.github.io/) and community contributions.

## Running the project

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `make build` in your terminal
3. Run `make serve` in your terminal and you will have the website running in `localhost:1313`

### How to contribute

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (git checkout -b feat/NewExample)
3. Commit your Changes (git commit -m 'feat: add new example')
    - In the case you just want to add a new example you need to create a new `markdown` file in `content/en/examples`, please keep in mind the following:
      - This text should be at the beggining of each file:
           ``` 
            ---
                title: "new-example"
                weight: X
                draft: false
            ---
        ```
    
        X determines the position of the example in the main page list.
      - The example should always include a `main` function.
      - Remember to **test and compile the example** in a separate project before copying the code.

    -  If you wish to submit a new translation to Spanish you just need to copy the example to `content/es/examples` and then make the necessary changes. Not everything should be translated. Some specific vocabulary in Software Development is better to keep it in English. For example: `Felt` doesn't have a natural translation.
4. Push to the Branch (git push origin feat/NewExample)
5. Open a Pull Request

And don't forget to give the project a star! ‚≠ê Thank you again for your support.
